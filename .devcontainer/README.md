## Developing with Visual Studio Code + devcontainer

The easiest way to get started with custom integration development is to use Visual Studio Code with devcontainers. This approach will create a preconfigured development environment with all the tools you need.

In the container you will have a dedicated Home Assistant core instance running with your custom component code. You can configure this instance by updating the `./devcontainer/configuration.yaml` file.

**Prerequisites**

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Docker
  -  For Linux, macOS, or Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise/Education use the [current release version of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
  -   Windows 10 Home requires [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/wsl2-install) and the current Edge version of Docker Desktop (see instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/)). This can also be used for Windows Pro/Enterprise/Education.
- [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Remote - Containers (VSC Extension)][extension-link]

**Getting started:**

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your computer.
3. Open the repository using Visual Studio code.

When you open this repository with Visual Studio code you are asked to "Reopen in Container", this will start the build of the container.

_If you don't see this notification, open the command palette and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container`._

### Tasks

The devcontainer comes with some useful tasks to help you with development, you can start these tasks by opening the command palette and select `Tasks: Run Task` then select the task you want to run.

When a task is currently running (like `Run Home Assistant on port 8123` for the docs), it can be restarted by opening the command palette and selecting `Tasks: Restart Running Task`, then select the task you want to restart.

The available tasks are:

Task | Description
-- | --
Run Home Assistant on port 8123 | Launch Home Assistant with your custom component code and the configuration defined in `.devcontainer/configuration.yaml`.

### Step by Step debugging

With the development container,
you can test your custom component in Home Assistant with step by step debugging.

You need to modify the `configuration.yaml` file in `.devcontainer` folder
by uncommenting the line:

```yaml
# debugpy:
```

Then launch the task `Run Home Assistant on port 8123`, and launch the debugger
with the existing debugging configuration `Python: Attach Local`.

For more information, look at [the Remote Python Debugger integration documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/debugpy/).
